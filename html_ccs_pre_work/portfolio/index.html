                <h1> Favorite Food </h1>
                <p>As I get older I find that what I thought were my favorite foods are not. A case in point, I use to really enjoy a true deep dish pizza, now I would rather have a thin crust olimpian style pizza. Now moving onto deserts, all real deserts work for me from pie to cookies. </p>

                <h1> Hobbies </h1>
                <p> I like MMORPG games the most. That being said i am starting to get into VR games they are just not there yet. I also like the console Video games, but it has been a while sense one isint just the same old game with a new skin.</p>
